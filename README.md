# Hex-maze-analysis

Some code to analyze hex maze data.

`plot_ramps.ipynb` plots dopamine ramps as the rat approaches a reward port.

`sharp_wave_ripple_analysis.ipynb` replicates some of Tim's analysis and investigates if post-reward SWRs are used to update place values (aka if hex DA is higher after hexes have been represented in SWRs).


PS - I use a function from the [Hex-maze](https://github.com/calderast/Hex-maze/tree/main) repo, so you should import it as a module to access it. I will figure out to have it as a module in this repo automatically but I haven't yet
