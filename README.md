# Hex-maze-analysis

Some code to analyze hex maze data.

`plot_ramps.ipynb` plots dopamine ramps as the rat approaches a reward port.

`sharp_wave_ripple_analysis.ipynb` replicates some of Tim's analysis and investigates if post-reward SWRs are used to update place values (aka if hex DA is higher after hexes have been represented in SWRs).

`theta_sweeps.ipynb` is my sandbox for investigating the role of theta sweeps in the decision process.

PS - The [Hex-maze](https://github.com/calderast/Hex-maze/tree/main) repo is imported as a module for this repo. I think everything should work if you clone it normally? Idk
